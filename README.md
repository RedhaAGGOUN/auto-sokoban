## üöÄ Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sokoban-project.git
    cd sokoban-project
    ```

2.  **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    A `requirements.txt` file is provided for easy installation.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the game:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## üéÆ How to Play

### Objective
The goal is to push every box onto a target location. You can only push one box at a time, and you cannot pull boxes.

### Controls
| Key(s)               | Action                      |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Arrow Keys / WASD**| Move the player             |
| **Z / U**            | Undo the last move          |
| **R**                | Restart the current level   |
| **H**                | Show the optimal solution   |
| **ESC / M**          | Return to the main menu     |

### Scoring
You earn stars based on how efficiently you solve a level. The number of stars is determined by comparing your move count to the optimal solution's move count.
*   **‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ**: Solved with the optimal number of moves.
*   **‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ**: Solved with a good number of moves (up to 1.5x optimal).
*   **‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ**: Solved the level.

## üõ†Ô∏è Level Editor

The level editor allows you to create and save your own Sokoban puzzles.

1.  **Select a Tool**: Choose a tool from the palette on the right (Wall, Eraser, Target, Box, Player).
2.  **Paint/Stamp**:
    *   **Paint Tools** (Wall, Eraser): Click and drag on the canvas to draw.
    *   **Stamp Tools** (Target, Box, Player): Click a single tile to place the object. The Player tool will automatically replace any existing player on the board.
3.  **Validation**: The editor provides real-time feedback to ensure your level is valid. A valid level must have:
    *   Exactly one Player.
    *   At least one Box.
    *   An equal number of Boxes and Targets.
4.  **Save & Test**: Once your level is valid, click the **"SAVE & TEST"** button. The game will run the solver to confirm the level is solvable. If it is, it will be saved to the `custom_levels/` directory and become available in the "Community Levels" menu.
